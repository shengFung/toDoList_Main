# To-Do List (Java + JavaFX)

This is a simple **To-Do List application** built using **Java** and **JavaFX**. It's a University semester 1 project.
It allows users to add, view, and manage daily tasks in a graphical interface.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: The code is quite messy because I built this project *before learning about classes and data structures*.  
> However, it still works fine! Please refer to the **requirements.pdf** in this repository for more detailed information about the project‚Äôs design and features.

For full experience:

*Email features* -  can be used only after you paste your own sender and receiver email, with app password needed. You also have to set one of the task due date to (today) or (tomorrow) to make it triggered.

*Reccurence,RCC feature* - All RCC have been set to 'None' to prevent spam in database, feel free to play around with RCC when you create new task but not current ones.
